# get-the-murcielago
A 2048 clone that features my favorite cars, ranked. Public opinion (not) accepted.

Inspired by [GetMIT](https://mitchgu.github.io/GetMIT/). Based on the popular game [2048 by Gabriele Cirulli](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/2048-by-gabriele-cirulli/id868076805). Starter code taken from [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZyylFcjfIg).

**Before the car bros come for me**, *yes*, I *know* there are rarer, more bespoke models out there than the Murcielago. I just love it because it's one of the last manual V12 Lambos with the iconic wedge design. Not that I'd say no to a Pagani if one came my way.
